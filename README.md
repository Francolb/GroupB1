# Multi-Tasking Robot README

## Task 1: Token Handling and Alignment

1. **Token Retrieval:**
   - The robot extracts various tokens from the feeder.

2. **Transportation to Fixture:**
   - Tokens are conveyed to the fixture for meticulous alignment.

3. **Alignment Process:**
   - At the fixture, the robot aligns each token with its corresponding form.

4. **Tray Placement:**
   - Aligned tokens are methodically placed on a tray.

## Task 2: Unconventional Token Stacking

1. **Token Pickup:**
   - The robot collects tokens from two trays.

2. **Stacking:**
   - Tokens are stacked in a deliberately messy and unaligned manner, demonstrating the robot's capability to handle disorder.

## Task 3: Tray Adjustment and Drawing

1. **Tray Configuration:**
   - The robot adjusts the second tray to a 30-degree angle.

2. **Token Pickup with Air Pressure Sensor:**
   - Tokens from the first tray are picked up if detected by an air pressure sensor.

3. **Placement on Second Tray:**
   - The robot places the detected tokens on the second tray.

4. **Marker Drawing:**
   - Using a marker, the robot draws "TASK 3 B1" as part of the operation.
